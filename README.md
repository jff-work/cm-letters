Python script for turning cardmarket orders into letters

This was a personal script I wrote for myself to simplify sending orders. It is was not inteded to be understood by other people and would need updating as the respective pages have changed quite dramatically.

Functionally what it was doing:
- logging into Cardmarket and obtaining order information
- logging into Swiss Postal services and creating the correct stamped letters and customs forms
- manipulating pdfs to merge all the letters and customs form into one printable pdf
